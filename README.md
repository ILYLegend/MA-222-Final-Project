# MA-222-Final-Project
R Studio project

Takes two provided datasets and uses my documentation to choose a "cool" graph to showcase. The R file has the documentation and the final graph is the "cool" graph, and has full documentation on what that graph found.
The final graph shows the interconnectedness of construction, manufacturing, real estate, and finance and insurance.
